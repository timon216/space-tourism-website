# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website solution

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

This solution is based on the guidance of Kevin Powell and his course [Build a space travel website on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel). His tutorial shows how to make home page, destination page and crew page, with many challenges along the way. I made some changes because some of his solutions didn't work as expected.

## Overview

This is my first "bigger" project. I decided to base my solution on Kevin Powell's tutorial because I wanted to see what it looks like to create a full page with subpages from beginning to the end. If I did it myself from scratch, I would change a few things - mostly the order of doing things because sometimes I was confused with jumping from topic to topic, when it came to writing a commit.

The figma files with full design can be downloaded from [Scrimba](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-Q_r2tiq43) page.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learnt

- how to make and use custom properties
- remember about a11y
- how to change content on the website with JS
- how to solve problems, when things shown in the tutorial doesn't work as expected (I had some problems, ex. with not working dot notation in grid-template-areas, not working attributes and selectors)
- where and how to look for information about things I have never done but I need them in my project
- how to make git repository

## Summary

Even though this solution is based on the tutorial, I think I learnt a lot and that knowledge will help me make a better design in the future. I completed challenges and finished the project on my own. Now I know more about organizing the work and keeping track of changes on GitHub. I am excited to do my own projects from scratch.
